### Entrepreneur Well-Being Project
## Overview
The Entrepreneur Well-Being Project delves into the challenges faced by entrepreneurs related to political integrity issues. Drawing inspiration from the Master's thesis by Gabriela Resende Gomes Guedes at the Federal University of Goias, Brazil, titled Ambiente Institucional e o Baixo NÃ­vel de Bem-Estar Cognitivo: O Direito de Propriedade e a Integridade Governamental Afetam os Empreendedores que Sofrem? (In Portuguese), this project aims to explore the impact of institutional environment and government integrity on the cognitive well-being of entrepreneurs.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from the year 2022, specifically from the Heritage Foundation for freedom indices related to the institutional environment. Additionally, data from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) from 2022 is employed to assess the well-being of entrepreneurs.

## Data Analysis
The analysis begins with a meticulous data gathering and cleaning process. Following this, statistical tests are performed to extract meaningful insights. The Shapiro-Wilk test is initially employed to assess the normality of the data, revealing a deviation from normal distribution.

In light of this non-normal distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis test is utilized to analyze variance differences among income groups, providing insights into how each variable varies across groups labeled 0, 1, and 2.

To validate and confirm the results, a post hoc test is conducted using the Bonferroni adjustment in the Dunn test, ensuring a controlled p-value. This meticulous statistical approach aims to establish the significance of the findings and their relevance to the well-being of entrepreneurs in the context of political integrity issues.

The Entrepreneur Well-Being Project contributes valuable insights to the intersection of entrepreneurship, political integrity, and cognitive well-being, shedding light on the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in today's complex institutional environments.
